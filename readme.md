Social Network for Pets
In this project, we’ll build a simple social network for pets. You’ll be able to view a pet’s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles. There will also be a profile directory where you can see all of the profiles.

We’ve already set up three profiles for you: one for a cat, one for a dog, and one for a Komodo dragon.

Let’s get started!
